Version 0.5.7 (2013-01-06)
	- Forgot to put /etc in front of cdmtty in the profile.sh

Version 0.5.6 (2013-01-06)
	- Add file LOCALBASE/etc/cdmtty that specifies where we want cdm to appear
	- Remove odd #!/bin/bash line from Makefile

Version 0.5.5 (2013-01-06)
	- Replace [[ statements with the equivalent test statements to make more portable
	- Don't assume we have runlevels to work with
	- Change the install file to Makefile
	- Remove all the hardcoded paths and make them templatable

Version 0.5.4 (2012-12-23)
	- Replace the normal cdm command in zzz-cdm-profile.sh to use /usr/bin/cdm instead of cdm to harden against user 
using their own modified cdm command. Not to mention, the install script does install there anyway...
	- Add xlogout script from an arch linux forum thread to assist people who are using standalone window managers 
(https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1179199)
	- Modified zzz-cdm-profile.sh to only show up on runlevel 4, since that will allow it to still show up on all 
ttys while allowing the administrator a good amount of room to work with a faulty CDM.
	- Added a more intelligent default wmbinlist and wmdisplist by using the session scraper script. This script can 
be used separately from cdm in order to generate a more customized menu from the output.
	- Remove the X display offset since startx does this on its own anyway? (Still undecided)
